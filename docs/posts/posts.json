The earliest attempts to model Brownian motion mathematically can be traced to three sources, each of which knew nothing about the others: the first was that of T. N. Thiele of Copenhagen, who effectively created a model of Brownian motion while studying time series in 1880 [81].2; the second was that of L. Bachelier of Paris, who created a model of Brownian motion while deriving the dynamic behavior of the Paris stock market, in 1900 (see, [1, 2, 11]); and the third was that of A. Einstein, who proposed a model of the motion of small particles suspended in a liquid, in an attempt to convince other physicists of the molecular nature of matter, in 1905 21 Of these three models, those of Thiele and Bachelier had little impact for a long time, while that of Einstein was immediately influential. We go into a little detail about what happened to Bachelier, since he is now seen by many as the founder of modern Mathematical Finance. Ignorant of the work of Thiele (which was little appreciated in its day) and preceding the work of Einstein, Bachelier attempted to model the market noise of the Paris Bourse. Exploiting the ideas of the Central Limit Theorem, and realizing that market noise should be without memory, he reasoned that increments of stock prices should be independent and normally distributed. He combined his reasoning with the Markov property and semigroups, and connected Brownian motion with the heat equation, using that the Gaussian kernel is the fundamental solution to the heat equation.\r\nAlbert Einstein\r\nLet us now turn to Einstein’s model. In modern terms, Einstein assumed that Brownian motion was a stochastic process with continuous paths, independent increments, and stationary Gaussian increments. He did not assume other reasonable properties (from the standpoint of physics), such as rectifiable paths. If he had assumed this last property, we now know his model would not have existed as a process. However, Einstein was unable to show that the process he proposed actually did exist as a mathematical object. This is understandable, since it was 1905, and the ideas of Borel and Lebesgue constructing measure theory were developed only during the first decade of the twentieth century. In 1913 Daniell’s approach to measure theory (in which integrals are defined before measures) appeared, and it was these ideas, combined with Fourier series, that N. Wiener used in 1923 to construct Brownian motion, justifying after the fact Einstein’s approach. Indeed, Wiener used the ideas of measure theory to construct a measure on the path space of continuous functions, giving the canonical path projection process the distribution of what we now know as Brownian motion. Wiener and others proved many properties of the paths of Brownian motion, an activity that continues to this day. Two key properties relating to stochastic integration are that (1) the paths of Brownian motion have a non zero finite quadratic variation, such that on an interval (s, t), the quadratic variation is (t−s) and (2) the paths of Brownian motion have infinite variation on compact time intervals, almost surely. The second property follows easily from the first. Note that if Einstein were to have assumed rectifiable paths, Wiener’s construction would have essentially proved the impossibility of such a model. In recognition of his work, his construction of Brownian motion is often referred to as the Wiener process. Wiener also constructed a multiple integral, but it was not what is known today as the “Multiple Wiener Integral”: indeed, it was K. Itˆo, in 1951, when trying to understand Wiener’s papers (not an easy task), who refined and greatly improved Wiener’s ideas [36].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
